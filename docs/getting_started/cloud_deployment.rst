     :target: https://colab.research.google.com/CK-Explorer/DuoSubs/blob/main/notebook/DuoSubs-webui.ipynb
     :alt: Colab

     :target: https://huggingface.co/spaces/CK-Explorer/DuoSubs

.. note::

    - Google Colab has a limited runtime allocation, especially when using the free instance.
    - On Hugging Face Spaces, only a few models are preloaded, and inference can be slower because it runs on CPU.
